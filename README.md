  "default": "I'm not sure about that. Please consult a healthcare professional."
};
```

## üöÄ Future Improvements

* Integrate **NLP models** (e.g., HuggingFace transformers) for better responses
* Add **speech-to-text & text-to-speech** support
* Store chat history in **database (SQLite/MongoDB)**
* Add **authentication** for patient-specific guidance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This chatbot is for **educational purposes only**.
It does **not** provide medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for medical concerns.

Would you like me to also create the **sample `app.py`, `index.html`, and `script.js`** so your chatbot is runnable right away, or just keep it at the documentation level?
